# How the game works?
Unlike [Battleship](./SimplePrograms/Battleship) that works only on a single row or 1D way, this [Battleshipmain](./SimplePrograms/Battleshipmain) works in a 2D way. Consider as a square where
the user has to provide input such as
```
A7
D2
C4
```
so the letters at the respective block would be hit / kill / miss where working is as [similar pattern in the simple Battleship](./SimplePrograms/Battleship/readMe.md)
