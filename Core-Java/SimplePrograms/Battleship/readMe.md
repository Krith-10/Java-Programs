# How the game works?
A row consists of letters at each position. The user should guess the element number in the row. If a letter is spotted
and correctly guessed the output would be as _hit_, in case any wrong guess then it would be _miss_ and if all the letter were correctly guessed then the output would be as _kill_.
The number of guesses done by the player would be shown at the end.
