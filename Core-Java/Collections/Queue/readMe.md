# Queue
Queue are collections that are designed to hold elements in the order which they are processed. They follow either FIFO or LILO. Sometimes [Deque](../Collections/Queue/Deques.java) could also act as LIFO.

[Stream](../Queue/Streams.java), the new feature in Java-8 that allows to perform functional styling on the elements.
